# Research

The article I read found that young Finnish adults (23 and 25 years old, which is very close to my age- 24) had nine categories of personal goals: work, education, relationships, finance, leisure-time, an apartment/housing and moving, health, lifestyle, and self (Marttinen et al., 2015, p.188). The results showed that work-related goals were the most common among both ages (Table 1).  The next most common goals related to education and relationships (Table 1). Self, lifestyle, and financial goals were the least common goals among the nine categories (Table 1).

This assessment is mostly in line with my own goals. I see finding a job to be my ultimate goal at the moment as I am going through university, networking, and taking work opportunities for that purpose. Concerning education, I listed graduating from my current program as a goal and I am also considering graduate school. I also highly value my friends and family, meaning that maintaining those relationships is an important goal for me. I was surprised that financial goals were not more common as finances are also something I consider carefully, though the study implies it may be because the participants were already working (Marttinen et al., 2015, p. 193). The findings about self and lifestyle are also in line with the way I listed my goals, as I had not considered goals for personal growth nor did I describe the lifestyle I desired (though some of it is implied through my other goals).
